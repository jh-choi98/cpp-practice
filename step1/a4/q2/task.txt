1. A vowel in English is one of (a, e,i,o,u). 
Write a function count-vowels that counts the vowels in a string. 
Both upper and lower case letters count. 

2. Write a function sorted? that consumes a list of strings and produces true if the strings
appear in strict lexicographic order and false otherwise. An empty list and a list
containing a single element are both in strict lexicographic order. 

For example:
(check-expect (sorted? (cons "hello" (cons "Hello" empty))) false)
(check-expect (sorted? (cons "Hi" (cons "hello" (cons "how are you" empty)))) true)
(check-expect (sorted? (cons "hello" (cons "hello" (cons "hey" (cons "hi" empty))))) false)

3. Write a function replace-word that consumes two strings and a list of strings, and
produces a new list where all occurrences of the first string have been replaced by the
second string.
For example:
(check-expect (replace-word "exam" "assessment" (cons "content" (cons "exam" (cons "assignment" empty))))
(cons "content" (cons "assessment" (cons "assignment" empty))))

4. Write a function remove-duplicates that consumes a list of Any and produces the same
list, with all but the last occurrence of each element removed. For example, if the input
was the list 1,3,1,2,4,2,7,2,5, the output would be the list 3,1,4,7,2,5. The order of
the elements in the consumed list needs to be maintained in the produced list.
For example:
(check-expect (remove-duplicates (cons 1 (cons 3 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 4 (cons 2 (cons 7 (cons 2 (cons 5 empty))))))))))
(cons 3 (cons 1 (cons 4 (cons 7 (cons 2 (cons 5 empty)))))))
